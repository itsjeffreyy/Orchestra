Welcome to Orchestra's documentation!
=====================================

Orchestra is a platform for running `custom` computing environments, each in the form of a Docker_ image, that can be shared and used by many remote users. For example, an Rstudio_ interface to a set of hands-on workshops can be shared with the entire class, eliminating software version and installation issues. A pre-installed set of python packages and associated `Jupyter notebooks`_ can accompany an institution`s published papers, allowing reviewers and interested readers to gain access to the exact data, software, and environment used in the manuscript. A complex web application that ingests user data could run inside the user's unique, private instance and when the instance is deleted, all user data is removed.
